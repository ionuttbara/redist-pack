# What is a runtime?

In computer programming, a runtime system or runtime environment is a sub-system that exists both in the computer where a program is created, as well as in the computers where the program is intended to be run.  
For example some apps which writed in some programming languages, need runtimes (.NET, C++, Java , F# , J# and another language).  

# Why i need that?

You need that to run programs and fix some file missing errors and uninstalled components, and fixes missed runtimes errors.
